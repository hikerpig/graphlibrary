# @pintora/graphlib

@pintora/graphlib is a JavaScript library that provides data structures for undirected and directed multi-graphs along with algorithms that can be used with them.

It's a fork of [graphlibrary](https://github.com/tylingsoft/graphlibrary), which is a fork of [dagrejs/graphlib](https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib). And it is designed as an out-of-box replacement for dagrejs/graphlib.
